          The Bhagavad Gita, often referred to as the "Gita," is a 700-verse
          Hindu scripture that is part of the Indian epic Mahabharata. It is a
          dialogue between Prince Arjuna and the god Krishna, who serves as his
          charioteer. In the midst of a great war, Arjuna is filled with doubt
          and moral dilemma about fighting in the battle. Krishna imparts
          spiritual wisdom and guidance to him, addressing his confusion and
          concerns, and revealing profound teachings on duty, righteousness, and
          the nature of reality.
